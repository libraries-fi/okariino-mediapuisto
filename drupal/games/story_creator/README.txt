Stories consist of pages. Pages have a set of characters for the player to choose from aswell as a short storyline into which the chosen character is then placed. The text is also available as an audio story. When the audio reaches the spot where a character has to be chosen, the audio will pause until a selection has been made. If the player had chosen a character before the audio reached a stop point, there will be no pause. The spot for a character is marked in the text version using AT LEAST three consecutive underscores. There may be more underscores if needed. Stop points in the audio track are defined in the 'pauses' variable in the Page item.

Characters have an icon, a text value used in the text version of the story and also an audio clip that contains the spoken name of the character suitable to be used in the corresponding section of the story. This means plurals and other forms of inflection have to be taken into account.
